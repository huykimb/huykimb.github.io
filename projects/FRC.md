When I started highschool and went to the club fairs for the first time, one of the clubs that stood out to me was the robotics club. I was tempted to join, but decided against it because I thought that it would be too difficult and intimidating being by myself since none of my friends at the time were interested in robotics. Fast-forward a few years, my engineering teacher approached me in my junior year to see if I would be interested in joining the Robotics team along with my other friend who I hadn't known before was previously in robotics in our freshman year. Since I was still interested in robotics, I decided to join with her, along with another friend that we convinced to join with us. 

When I went to the introductory meeting, the advisors warned us that the club would be large commitment, with studnents having to stay until late hours in the day from after school to evenings, and worst case scenario, we would have to work on the robot until the day after and stay overnight. However, I still joined despite this because I wanted to see for myself what the club was like and thought that getting to experience building a robot would be worth it.

When I officially joined, I was given 2 choices: join the mechanical team or the electrical team. The mechanical team would would work on assembling and planning the compartments of the robot. Then, the electrical team would involve working on the electrical side of things, like coding and fiddling with a raspberry pi to control the robot. I wanted to join the electrical team because the idea of coding a robot sounded cool. However, I decided to join the mechanical team with my friend to even out the numbers since joining the electrical team would mean that only two people would be working on the mechanical side. 

I had a difficult time adjusting to everything at first, since I had zero prior knowledge and experience using tools and machinery.
