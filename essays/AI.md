*The Use of AI*


## Introduction
AI has always been a controversial topic since its rise in popularity in technical, academic, and creative fields. Because of this, some people are either heavily against it or support its use in education. I believe that the use of AI is acceptable, but only when it’s used properly and not used in a way that gets in the way of learning. For this course, I primarily used ChatGPT and Github Copilot.

## Personal Experience with AI
I initially had concerns about using AI in this class as it would be considered cheating in other courses and I felt that the optimal way to learn was teaching myself, but since we were allowed to, I found that I could use it freely in my learning and as a resource to learn from and get immediate feedback, especially on concepts that I found difficult. I also used it whenever I struggled to setup programs or ran into technical issues that I could not figure out on my own. For example, I found it difficult to set up things like Prisma and PostgreSQL for the Experience WODs, as they required installation through the terminal, which would give me errors when I tried to install them directly following the instruction guides on their websites. AI was a great help in this aspect, as I could figure out the issues step-by-step and resolve them through the answers that it provided. For in-class WODs and in-class practice WODs, I was wary of using AI in the beginning as I felt that I wouldn’t be doing the WODs as they were intended if I relied on AI. However, as the semester went by, I figured that I wasn’t learning from the WODs at all by passively doing them, since I wasn’t able to finish them in their given time, which is why I began to use them in class. After doing this, I was able to make more progress in my learning as I wasn’t stuck on issues I had before and I could learn and apply the solutions provided by AI on similar issues again on my own. It might seem hypocritical since I’ve already used AI plenty of times at this point academically, but I think one of the areas that AI shouldn’t be used on is creative fields like writing, as it completely strips away any emotions and individuality from it. The only exception I would make is using it to check grammar and seeing if what I write is appropriate in the context of wherever I’m addressing the writing to, but for assignments like the essays for this class, I wouldn’t ever use it. For the final project, I found that AI was helpful as it helped me with things like React and other things like importing components, which were required. I wasn’t familiar with React, so I relied heavily on AI for this. I’ve used AI for learning concepts/tutorials and I find it useful as it helps me understand the material better. I didn’t use AI for answering a question in class or in Discord because I didn’t find the need to. Similarly, I didn’t use it for asking or answering a smart-question either because of this. I’ve used it to get coding examples as it helped me learn better, with prompts like “how to _” and “give me an example of what _ is”. It also helped me explain code that I didn’t understand. For example, sometimes there would be syntax or functions that I wouldn’t understand the logic of, so AI helped explain it more it in a more simple manner for me to understand. I’ve used it for writing code when dealing with concepts that I’ve never seen before, so it gives me a place to start. I didn’t see the need to use it for documenting code as I could do that on my own. For quality assurance, when I run into errors, I paste the existing code I have and see what went wrong in my process or logic which AI helped check.

## Impacts on Learning
I believe that the incorporation of AI in my learning has helped me a lot, and I would not have made as much progress in the time that I did without it. It improved the quality of my code, helped me digest new concepts better, and helped me find issues in my logic which I could learn from. In terms of practical application, I feel like their development is crucial for future advancements in healthcare and technology, which can help people and families immensely.

For this course, I felt that half the time that I was using AI was helping my learning, while the other half was spent worrying about whether I was potentially too reliant on it and that maybe it was actually impacting my learning negatively. Since I’ve used it for a lot of things, I sometimes ran into times where I thought that I should have already known certain concepts and have a good grasp of them when I didn’t. This demotivated me, but also encouraged me to learn and care more about the material I was focusing on. I think AI has that effect on a lot of people, but it’s a valid way of learning software engineering as technology is growing. I think people tend to misuse it a lot, but being used properly in a way that encourages people to learn more on their own is good.
