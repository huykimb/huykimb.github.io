*The Journey To Discovering Typescript*


## Introduction to Coding

When I was in middle school, I had the chance to take a coding class for the first time. The most memorable projects I had were basic ones, like converting binary to letters, numbers and symbols, and creating a map and layout of my school using HTML and CSS. This was also my first introduction to website development. Even though there wasn’t much real coding, and the things I learned were surface level, I still found it enjoyable. When I got into high school, I met some people that were interested in coding as well, which motivated me to continue learning about it and take more classes that were offered at my high school. I took AP Computer Science Principles, where I learned Javascript and more HTML and CSS. It was a new but difficult experience for me because I never fully understood the syntax, so most of the time spent on that class was recalling how and why certain syntax and methods worked, but never practicing them outside of that with projects. When I got into college, I took an introductory computer science course and learned Java. This was a completely new experience for me as well since the class focused on algorithms, which was something I admittedly never paid attention to or cared about before, but I had some prior experience with Java in AP Computer Science A, so learning the syntax wasn’t too bad. At this point, I had already forgotten that I had ever taken Javascript since I never touched it again outside of my class in high school. It was also a weird time because I took the Javascript class during COVID, so everything was uncertain and coding wasn’t my focus at the time so I quickly moved on from it. However, last semester when I was updating my resume, I suddenly realized that I did in fact learn Javascript at some point in my life. So naturally, the first thing I did was add it to my resume. 


## Discovering Typescript

If I was being honest, I didn't even know that Typescript was a thing until a few weeks ago. 

## In the context of relationships

So in the end, we realize that all engineering and programming is there for a reason - to serve human needs. Maybe that's why those things are difficult, because they both involve humans and are for humans.

Relationships, regardless if they're romantic or not take work. Humans are fickle creatures and relationships can come and go with the wind. To properly maintain something over time requires work. Family takes work. Marriage takes work. We live to figure out what works and what doesn't and hope that as we move forward we're improving.

Relationships have always been difficult, and by nature will continue to be so.

## Okay!

So back to the original premise; why is being one of the club officers so difficult?

And the final answer - it's supposed to be difficult, and it's supposed to challenge you, just like everything else that humans do that is difficult: programming, engineering, engaging in relationships, pondering the universe, etc.

Ultimately the question you should really ask yourself if something if particularly difficult is then "is it worth it"? That is something that is context specific and only you can answer yourself.
