*Reflection on Typescript*


## Introduction to Coding

When I was in middle school, I had the chance to take a coding class for the first time. The most memorable projects I had were basic ones, like converting binary to letters, numbers and symbols, and creating a map and layout of my school using HTML and CSS. This was also my first introduction to website development. Even though there wasn’t much real coding, and the things I learned were surface level, I still found it enjoyable. When I got into high school, I met some people that were interested in coding as well, which motivated me to continue learning about it and take more classes that were offered at my high school. I took AP Computer Science Principles, where I learned Javascript and more HTML and CSS. It was a new but difficult experience for me because I never fully understood the syntax, so most of the time spent on that class was recalling how and why certain syntax and methods worked, but never practicing them outside of that with projects. When I got into college, I took an introductory computer science course and learned Java. This was a completely new experience for me as well since the class focused on algorithms, which was something I admittedly never paid attention to or cared about before, but I had some prior experience with Java in AP Computer Science A, so learning the syntax wasn’t too bad. At this point, I had already forgotten that I had ever taken Javascript since I never touched it again outside of my class in high school. It was also a weird time because I took the Javascript class during COVID, so everything was uncertain and coding wasn’t my focus at the time so I quickly moved on from it. However, last semester when I was updating my resume, I suddenly realized that I did in fact learn Javascript at some point in my life. So naturally, the first thing I did was add it to my resume.

## Discovering Typescript

I didn't know that Typescript was a language that existed until a few weeks ago. When I was preparing for the semester by reviewing Javascript and HTML/CSS, I heard some mentions of Typescript, but I thought it was a completely separate language from Javascript so I wouldn’t have to worry about it. When I discovered that I had to learn it alongside Javascript, I was worried that it would be hard, but thankfully they were similar. I think it’s useful since it can be used to catch errors that Javascript has. This style of learning is new to me, but I think it’s useful since I can actually apply the things I learn from each module directly on the assignments. I’m still in the process of learning the languages so I’ve made a lot of mistakes, but I hope to keep improving and using it to successfully complete WODs and use it for future projects.
