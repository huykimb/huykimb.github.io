*Design Patterns*


## Comparing Design Patterns to the Real-World

When you walk around a city, you'll notice numerous buildings and shops that have similar structures. Those were built from blueprints, with steps found through trial and error and repeated practice and research which engineers, carpetners, electricians, and many more have spent years gaining experience in doing. This process is something fundamental to programming, with some occurences having been encountered so commonly that they can be replicated and solved over hundreds of times. This reusability allows many programmers to easily grasp concepts and solve issues that might have taken them longer to tackle if the patterns weren't seen beforehand. This is seen in areas such as  data structures and algorithms, as well as ones like website and app development. These patterns can be used to maintain code as well, which helps programmers organize their code neatly to be readable for other programmers.
