*UI Frameworks*


## Introduction to Bootstrap 5
During the process of learning HTML and CSS, I was able to use the experience and concepts I had learned before taking the class to apply to the websites that I had to build for my assignments and WODs. 

When I learned that we would have to build our projects using Bootstrap 5, I was excited because it was one of the first frameworks that I had ever heard of. I was already aware that it was one of the more popular things to use in the field and something that potential employers might be interested in since it was something that I commonly saw in other people’s resumes. Other than Bootstrap, I’ve heard of other frameworks like Angular and Tailwind, which I’m also hoping to use eventually since I haven’t had the chance to try them yet, but right now I’m not sure how they differ from Bootstrap.

## Perks and Downsides of UI Frameworks
I don’t think it’s efficient to use raw HTML and CSS to build websites from scratch because it would be too time consuming to create each component individually. However, I think it’s situational and case-by-case, because if I was hypothetically given a task by my team to create something specific for our website for a project, I might be better off with attempting to build it on my own rather than relying on a framework because then I have more control over how it works and what goes where and I won’t be limited to just the resources and templates that the framework provides me. However, if the project requested something simpler or less emphasis was placed on building custom objects for the front-end aspect of the website, using frameworks would undoubtedly be the better option because then it gives me enough freedom to still customize my page according to the project’s requirements, while also allowing me to spend less time on it and working through it faster with the assistance of presets.   

## Personal Conclusion
Personally, I do think that there might be a learning curve for learning frameworks like Bootstrap 5 because there are too many resources and options that it provides, so it would take a while to go through them all and figure out what all their uses are. However, I think after a while it gets easier. I found Bootstrap to be helpful since I didn’t have to adjust all the margins and colors or adjust things like buttons and navbars manually each time. I think if I spent some more time on this, I could get better and use it more efficiently, but right now I’m still confused about some aspects of it and understanding what everything does, so I want to focus on that first. Overall, I had fun using Bootstrap and will consider using it on my projects later. I’m excited to learn more UI frameworks in the future.
