## Reflecting on Software Engineering

Before I took this class, I didn’t know what to expect because when I talked to people that previously took this course, they all told me that this was one of the classes that they either got the most experience from, or that everything was fast-paced and learning had to be done on their own. Now that I’ve taken the class, I can agree with those sentiments. Learning software engineering in general takes a lot of time and effort, so doing so in a short time frame of one semester was even more challenging. I learned a lot of new terminology, languages, styles of coding, coding standards, frameworks (libraries with preset templates for coding), and how to manage things like databases (storage for users and data) and playwright testing (automated testing to ensure that everything works properly). I’ve always heard of terms like Bootstrap, React, Tailwind, Typescript, Postgres, databases, but I was never familiar with them. I never put much emphasis on coding standards, but  taking this class let me learn about things like ESLint and how to keep my code up to par with coding standards and how to properly format my code. This was useful because before I would have formatted my code as I wanted to, but that ended up being unorganized and I would end up with errors because of the lack of structure and code that was all over the place and hard to read. ESLint helped with that, as it gave me a way to code while being able to catch any potential structural issues that would give me errors later on. Additionally, this class let me learn about different ways to manage projects, such as the Agile method with Issue Driven Project Management where we could divide different tasks for each issue that we wanted to fix or features that we wanted to implement in a sheet. This was a good way to organize our projects. Before I knew about ESLint, I would’ve used Google Docs or another method to keep track of every group member’s tasks which turned out to be inefficient. Through keeping up with coding standards, I’ve learned how to use the GitHub issues page along with features like Pull Requests to avoid merge conflicts with different issue branches with the assigned issue names from the issues in the project page. Overall, this class allowed me to learn more about software engineering and how to implement different methods into my coding to collaborate more effectively with people, keep my code organized, and include things like frameworks, databases, and testing into my projects.
