I was first introduced to programming by my 4th grade teacher who invited over her younger brother to do a presentation on learning how to code through a website called "Scratch". Even though I found it interesting, I didn't think too much of it at the time because I wasn't a very techy kid and was more invested in art and creative activities. After that, I always found coding to be cool and correlated it with something that only smart people could do. When I got into the 7th grade, I was surprised to see that a coding class was offered, so I decided to take it. From then on, I took more coding classes further into high school and eventually decided that it could be a potential career for me. Comparing programming from then to now, my perspective on it has definitely changed. I thought it was simpler back then because I wasn't aware of all the algorithms and things needed that went into programming large-scale projects. Because of this, I found limitations within myself that I hope to overcome now. 

Some things that I've found interesting that I hadn't before are web development, front-end and back-end, software development, mobile development, game development, and robotics. I haven't done anything related to AI/ML yet, but I find that interesting too so I hope to eventually, and maybe cybersecurity and data science as well.
