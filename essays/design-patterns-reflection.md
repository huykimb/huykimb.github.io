*Design Patterns*


## Comparing Design Patterns to the Real-World

When you walk around a city, you'll notice numerous buildings and shops that have similar structures. Those were built from blueprints, with steps found through trial and error, repeated practice, observations, and research which engineers, carpenters, electricians, and many more have spent years gaining experience in doing. This process is something fundamental to programming, with some occurences having been encountered so commonly that they can be replicated and solved over hundreds of times. This reusability allows many programmers to easily grasp concepts and solve issues that might have taken them longer to tackle if the patterns weren't seen beforehand. This is seen in areas with research being done for a while such as data structures and algorithms, as well as ones like website and app development, where people have created frameworks that have prebuilt templates and coding strucure to create organized websites and with ease. These patterns can be used to maintain code as well, which helps programmers organize their code neatly to be readable for other programmers, and can be done with tools like ESLint to keep code free from errors and maintain them properly for other programmers to merge their code with without running into conflicts. In summary, through years of observation and experience, people have been able to find patterns and use them to their advantage to code efficiently and effectively, which can help everyone.
