*Coding Standards*


## Introduction to ESLint
When I was working on ESLint for the first time, I went in without knowing what to expect, but one thing that I wasn’t prepared for was the time that it would take to set up.

I ran into multiple errors while trying to do so, and the whole process took me about 30 minutes to fix, not including the time spent setting it up on VSCode.

When I tried following directions on the website from the FreeCodeCamp NVM installation guide for Macs, I copied and pasted the commands that were on the site step-by-step, like curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash and nvm -v, but source ~/.bashrc and nvm -v wouldn’t work no matter how many times I tried so I added export NVM_DIR= ... "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" to update my profile configuration, and when that didn't work, I tried reinstalling it by using curl ... install.sh again. I almost gave up because I kept getting an error message that said something along the lines of the terminal not being able to find the file or that it didn’t exist. Then somehow, when I messed around with some more things by randomly copying and pasting things I found on the internet in my terminal, I finally got it to work, but I don't know what it was that I did that made it work. I was just relieved to finally see the message showing me that NVM was installed successfully. Then, I moved on to using it in VSCode when I thought I was finally done. However, I ran into even more issues because npm install wouldn’t work and setting up the packages were confusing as well. However, it all worked out somehow in the end and I don’t have any more issues with it.
